# VideoToASCII

VideoToASCII lets you easily convert short videos into fun ASCII animations that you can share with anyone as a `.txt` file.

## Getting Started
To convert a video, clone the repo and edit `__main__.py` to suit your needs. On the fifth line, change `'test-videos/1.mp4'` to the path to the video that you would like to convert. On the seventh line, change `'test-animations/1.txt'` to the path to the output `.txt` file. After making these changes, run `python3 .` in the directory in which the program is, wait for the "done check it out" message, and you're all set!
